## Description üíæ
Every good projects need a professional README in order to transfer information and spread knowledge about the app.
A README explains precisely what the app is about, how to use, how to install,  how to report issues and how to contribute to the app for further development.

This application is a command-line based application that is run with Node.js. When run, it generates a README.md file based on the user's output. This enables us to quickly generate a professional README.md file instead of going through the trouble to write every code within the README for every project.
